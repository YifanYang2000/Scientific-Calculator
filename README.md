# Scientific-Calculator
A calculator GUI that serves as a ... well ... a calculator!

### Let's try it out
Make sure to have Python 3 installed.

Download the code and plug it into your editor.

Run it and a GUI should appear.

Have fun! The calculator works like any calculator.

### Improvements?
I will try to add more function such as sin or cos over time to try and replicate modern calculators.

Stay tuned!
